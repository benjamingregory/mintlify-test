## Introduction to the Coplay API

Coplay offers a C# API that allows Unity developers to access AI capabilities programmatically, enabling deeper integration with your development workflow and custom tools.

## Key Capabilities

With the Coplay API, you can:

- Generate code snippets and scripts programmatically
- Get AI assistance in your custom editor tools
- Analyze game objects and components
- Create AI-powered custom inspectors
- Integrate AI assistance into your build pipeline

## Getting Started

To use the Coplay API in your project, first ensure you have the Coplay package installed and authenticated in your Unity project.

### Basic Implementation

Here's a simple example of using the Coplay API to generate code:

```csharp
using Coplay;
using UnityEngine;

public class CoplayCodeHelper : MonoBehaviour
{
    public async void GenerateMovementScript()
    {
        // Create a request to Coplay
        var request = new CoplayRequest
        {
            Prompt = "Create a script for a third-person character controller with smooth rotation",
            ContextType = CoplayContextType.CSharpScript,
            MaxTokens = 1000
        };

        // Send the request and get the response
        var response = await CoplayAPI.GenerateCodeAsync(request);

        // Use the response
        if (response.Success)
        {
            Debug.Log("Generated script: " + response.Code);
            // You could save this to a new file, display in the editor, etc.
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("Failed to generate code: " + response.ErrorMessage);
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication

The Coplay API uses your existing Coplay authentication. As long as you're signed in to Coplay in your Unity Editor, your API calls will be authenticated automatically.

For CI/CD environments or headless usage, you can authenticate using an API key:

```csharp
CoplayAPI.Initialize("your-api-key");
```

<Note>
  API keys are available on the Professional and Enterprise plans. Join our
