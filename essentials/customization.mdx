Coplay integrates seamlessly with Unity through an intuitive interface designed to enhance your game development workflow. This guide explains all the UI elements you'll encounter when using Coplay.

## Context

The Context dropdown determines what information Coplay has access to when responding to your queries:

- **File Tree**: Provides access to your project's file structure
- **Project Settings**: Gives context about your Unity project configuration
- **Active Scene**: Includes information about the currently open scene
- **Git History**: Provides access to version control information
- **Packages**: Shows information about installed packages

**Example usage**: Select "Active Scene" when asking Coplay to help optimize game objects in your current scene, or select "Project Settings" when troubleshooting configuration issues.

## Mode

The Mode dropdown lets you select specialized AI modes optimized for different tasks:

- **Normal**: Balanced mode for general Unity development queries
- **Agent**: Mode for Coplay to take on independent tasks involving longer reasoning
- **SceneGeneration**: Specialized mode for creating and modifying Unity scenes
- **UIGeneration**: Focused on UI development tasks and solutions

**Example usage**: Switch to "SceneGeneration" mode when asking Coplay to help design a level layout, or use "UIGeneration" when working on your game's user interface elements.


## Model

Coplay lets you choose between the latest AI models from the major foundational providers, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, X.AI. Each of these models carries with it its own strengths:

- **claude-3-7-sonnet**: Balanced model with strong reasoning capabilities (default)
- **gpt-4.1**: Advanced model with strong code generation
- **o3** / **o4-mini**: Faster response times for simpler queries
- **grok-3**: Alternative model with different reasoning patterns
- **gemini-2-5-pro** / **gemini-2-5-flash**: Google's AI models with varying capabilities

**Example usage**: Select "claude-3-7-sonnet" for complex programming tasks, or switch to "o4-mini" when you need quick responses for simpler questions.


## Context
The action context dropdown (showing "move" in the example) lets you specify what type of operation you're performing. This helps Coplay understand and assist with specific actions like:

- Moving objects
- Scaling objects
- Rotating objects
- Adding components
- And more

**Example usage**: Select "move" when positioning objects in a scene, then ask Coplay for suggestions on optimal placement.

## Action Recording

Coplay can record your actions in the Unity Editor, allowing you to:

1. Track movements and changes to game objects
2. Delete specific recorded actions using the "Ã—" button
3. Clear all recorded actions at once
4. Save recordings for future reference

When you've finished recording actions, you can save them with a custom name:

**Example usage**: Record a sequence of object placements to document your level design process, then ask Coplay to analyze the pattern or suggest improvements.
