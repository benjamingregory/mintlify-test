## Image Processing Instructions

To prepare these images:

1. **Crop the Screenshots**: Use an image editing tool to crop each original screenshot to focus only on the specific UI element described.

2. **Save in the Correct Format**: Save each cropped image as a PNG file with the filename indicated in parentheses above.

3. **Place in Images Directory**: Add all prepared images to the `/images/` directory in the project.

4. **Optimize for Web**: Consider optimizing the images for web display (reducing file size while maintaining quality).

## Example Image Processing Steps

Using an image editing tool like Photoshop, GIMP, or even built-in OS tools:

1. Open the original screenshot
2. Select the crop tool
3. Draw a selection around only the relevant UI element (for example, just the context dropdown menu)
4. Crop the image
5. Save the cropped image with the appropriate filename (e.g., "context-dropdown.png")
6. Repeat for each required image

## Alternative Approach

If creating individual cropped images isn't feasible, you could:

1. Add the full screenshots to the `/images/` directory
2. Update the references in the documentation to point to these full screenshots
3. Add descriptions that help users identify which part of the screenshot is being referenced

## Next Steps

Once all images are prepared and added to the `/images/` directory, the documentation will display the UI elements properly, making it easier for users to understand Coplay's interface.
