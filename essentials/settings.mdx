Coplay offers extensive customization options through its settings interface.

Key settings include:

- **Coplay User**: Your account email address
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for your installation
- **Highlight Changes**: When enabled, Coplay will highlight changes it makes to your code
- **Enable Autocomplete**: Activates AI-powered code completion as you type
- **Show New Task Confirmation**: Enables confirmation dialog when starting new tasks

You can also manage custom rules through the "Edit Custom Coplay Rules" button, which opens this dialog:

Custom rules allow you to create specialized instructions for Coplay that will be saved to `.coplayrules.md` in your project root folder.

**Example usage**: Create custom rules like "Always comment public methods" or "Follow our team's naming convention" to ensure Coplay adheres to your project standards.
