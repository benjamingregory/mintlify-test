Coplay offers extensive customization options through its settings interface.

Key settings include:

- **Coplay User**: Your account email address
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for your installation device
- **Highlight Changes**: When enabled, Coplay will highlight changes it makes to your projects
- **Enable Autocomplete**: Activates AI-powered code completion as you type
- **Show New Task Confirmation**: Enables confirmation dialog when starting new tasks

You can also manage custom rules through the "Edit Custom Coplay Rules" button,
which opens a dialog enabling you to create specialized instructions for Coplay
that will be saved to `.coplayrules.md` in your project root folder.
This will cause Coplay to include this as additional context before it takes any action.

**Example usage**: Create custom rules like "Always comment public methods"
or "Follow our team's naming convention" to ensure Coplay adheres to your project standards.
You can also reference other files if you have pre-existing instructions / best practices:
"Before any task is started, read handovernotes.md to understand the dependencies and
context of the project you are working on."
