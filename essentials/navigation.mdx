## The Coplay Interface

After installing Coplay and signing in, you'll have access to its interface directly within the Unity Editor. Understanding how to navigate this interface will help you make the most of Coplay's capabilities.

## Accessing Coplay

There are two main ways to access Coplay in Unity:

1. **Menu Bar**: Click on the **Coplay** option in the Unity Editor's top menu bar
2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Use **Command+G** (Mac) or **Control+G** (Windows)

<Note>
  The keyboard shortcut is the quickest way to toggle the Coplay panel while
  working in Unity.

## Interface Components

### Main Chat Panel

The central component of Coplay is the chat interface, which consists of:

<img
  src="/images/hero-light.png"
  alt="Coplay Chat Interface"
  className="block dark:hidden rounded-lg"
/>

<img
  src="/Group1.png"
  alt="Coplay Chat Interface Dark"
  className="hidden dark:block rounded-lg"
/>

1. **Message History**: Displays the conversation between you and Coplay
2. **Input Field**: Where you type your questions and requests
3. **Send Button**: Submits your message to Coplay
4. **Clear Conversation Button**: Starts a fresh conversation

### Toolbar

At the top of the Coplay panel, you'll find a toolbar with several useful options:

<CodeGroup>

```text Available Commands
- Sign In/Out: Authenticate your Coplay session
- Settings: Configure Coplay preferences
- Model Selection: Choose which AI model to use
- Help: Access quick help information
- Minimize: Collapse the Coplay panel
```

</CodeGroup>

### Context Panel

Coplay understands the context of your Unity project, including:

- The currently open scene
- Selected game objects
- Active scripts and components
- Project structure and assets

This contextual awareness helps Coplay provide more relevant assistance.

## Using Coplay Effectively

### Context Commands

You can enhance Coplay's understanding by providing specific context:

<CodeGroup>

```text Context Commands
"Look at my PlayerController script"
"Analyze the selected GameObject"
"Consider the current scene hierarchy"
"Focus on the collision system in my game"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Conversation Flow

Coplay conversations work best when they follow a natural progression:

1. **Start with a clear question or request**
2. **Review Coplay's response**
3. **Ask follow-up questions for clarification or to explore related topics**
4. **Implement suggestions and report back on results if needed**

## Customizing the Interface

You can customize how Coplay appears in your Unity Editor through the Settings menu:

- **Theme**: Choose between light, dark, or system-matched themes
- **Font Size**: Adjust for better readability
- **Window Position**: Dock Coplay in different areas of the Unity Editor
- **Persistence**: Configure whether Coplay stays open when switching contexts

<Warning>
  Changing some settings may require restarting the Unity Editor to take effect.
