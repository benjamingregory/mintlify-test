# Coplay Interface Elements

Coplay integrates seamlessly with Unity through an intuitive interface designed to enhance your game development workflow. This guide explains all the UI elements you'll encounter when using Coplay.

## Main Interface Components

The Coplay interface consists of several key components that allow you to interact with the AI assistant and manage your development context.

### Context Dropdown

</Frame>

The Context dropdown determines what information Coplay has access to when responding to your queries:

- **File Tree**: Provides access to your project's file structure
- **Project Settings**: Gives context about your Unity project configuration
- **Active Scene**: Includes information about the currently open scene
- **Git History**: Provides access to version control information
- **Packages**: Shows information about installed packages

**Example usage**: Select "Active Scene" when asking Coplay to help optimize game objects in your current scene, or select "Project Settings" when troubleshooting configuration issues.

### Agent Mode Selection

The Agent dropdown lets you select specialized AI modes optimized for different tasks:

- **Normal**: Balanced mode for general Unity development queries
- **SceneGeneration**: Specialized mode for creating and modifying Unity scenes
- **UIGeneration**: Focused on UI development tasks and solutions

**Example usage**: Switch to "SceneGeneration" mode when asking Coplay to help design a level layout, or use "UIGeneration" when working on your game's user interface elements.

### Model Selection

</Frame>

Coplay lets you choose between different AI models, each with its own strengths:

- **claude-3-7-sonnet**: Balanced model with strong reasoning capabilities (default)
- **gpt-4.1**: Advanced model with strong code generation
- **o3** / **o4-mini**: Faster response times for simpler queries
- **grok-3**: Alternative model with different reasoning patterns
- **gemini-2-5-pro** / **gemini-2-5-flash**: Google's AI models with varying capabilities

**Example usage**: Select "claude-3-7-sonnet" for complex programming tasks, or switch to "o4-mini" when you need quick responses for simpler questions.

### Action Recording

</Frame>

Coplay can record your actions in the Unity Editor, allowing you to:

1. Track movements and changes to game objects
2. Delete specific recorded actions using the "Ã—" button
3. Clear all recorded actions at once
4. Save recordings for future reference

When you've finished recording actions, you can save them with a custom name:

</Frame>

**Example usage**: Record a sequence of object placements to document your level design process, then ask Coplay to analyze the pattern or suggest improvements.

### Action Context

</Frame>

The action context dropdown (showing "move" in the example) lets you specify what type of operation you're performing. This helps Coplay understand and assist with specific actions like:

- Moving objects
- Scaling objects
- Rotating objects
- Adding components
- And more

**Example usage**: Select "move" when positioning objects in a scene, then ask Coplay for suggestions on optimal placement.

## Settings Interface

Coplay offers extensive customization options through its settings interface.

</Frame>

Key settings include:

- **Coplay User**: Your account email address
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for your installation
- **Highlight Changes**: When enabled, Coplay will highlight changes it makes to your code
- **Enable Autocomplete**: Activates AI-powered code completion as you type
- **Show New Task Confirmation**: Enables confirmation dialog when starting new tasks

You can also manage custom rules through the "Edit Custom Coplay Rules" button, which opens this dialog:

</Frame>

Custom rules allow you to create specialized instructions for Coplay that will be saved to `.coplayrules.md` in your project root folder.

**Example usage**: Create custom rules like "Always comment public methods" or "Follow our team's naming convention" to ensure Coplay adheres to your project standards.

## Tips for Effective UI Navigation

1. **Context-Aware Queries**: Always select the appropriate context for your question to get the most relevant answers
2. **Mode Switching**: Change agent modes based on your current development focus
3. **Model Selection**: Use faster models for simple tasks and more advanced models for complex problems
4. **Action Recording**: Use action recording to document processes that you want to analyze or replicate later
5. **Custom Rules**: Set up custom rules to ensure Coplay aligns with your team's development standards
