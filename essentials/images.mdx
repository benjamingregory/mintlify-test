## Scene Understanding

One of Coplay's most powerful features is its ability to understand and reason about visual elements in your Unity project. Coplay can analyze your scenes, GameObjects, materials, and more to provide context-aware assistance.

### Scene Analysis

Ask Coplay to analyze your current scene to get insights and suggestions:

```
"Analyze my current scene for performance issues"
"Help me understand the hierarchy of this level"
"What could I improve about my character's animation setup?"
```

### GameObject Inspection

Coplay can inspect selected GameObjects and provide detailed information:

## Visual Debugging

Coplay helps you visualize and debug issues in your Unity project.

### Debug Visualization

Ask Coplay to help you visualize debugging information:

```csharp
// Ask Coplay to generate code for debug visualization
"Create debug visualization for my character's pathfinding"

// Coplay might suggest:
void OnDrawGizmos()
{
    Gizmos.color = Color.yellow;

    // Draw the path
    if (path != null && path.Length > 0)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < path.Length - 1; i++)
        {
            Gizmos.DrawLine(path[i], path[i + 1]);
        }
    }

    // Draw the detection range
    Gizmos.color = Color.red;
    Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(transform.position, detectionRadius);
}
```

## Learning Through Visuals

<Tip>
  Coplay works best when it can see your Unity Editor. For complex problems,
  consider sharing a screenshot of your scene or hierarchy with Coplay for more
  accurate assistance.
</Tip>

### Video Tutorials

Coplay can recommend specific video tutorials based on what you're working on:

```
"Show me tutorials on implementing a dialogue system"
"I need help with Unity's new Input System"
"What's the best way to learn shader programming for Unity?"
```

## 3D Model and Asset Analysis

Coplay can provide insights on your 3D models and assets:

```
"Is this model optimized for mobile?"
"How can I improve the textures on this character?"
"What's the polycount of this selected model?"
```

## UI Design Assistance

Coplay can help you design and implement UI systems in Unity:

```csharp
// Ask Coplay for UI layout suggestions
"Design a mobile-friendly inventory UI"

// Coplay might suggest code and layout considerations:
[SerializeField] private int gridSize = 5;
[SerializeField] private float cellSize = 100f;
[SerializeField] private float cellSpacing = 10f;
[SerializeField] private GameObject inventoryItemPrefab;

void CreateInventoryGrid(Transform parent)
{
    // Calculate the total size
    float totalWidth = (cellSize + cellSpacing) * gridSize - cellSpacing;

    // Create the grid
    for (int y = 0; y < gridSize; y++)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < gridSize; x++)
        {
            // Create item slot
            GameObject slot = Instantiate(inventoryItemPrefab, parent);
            RectTransform rectTransform = slot.GetComponent<RectTransform>();

            // Position the slot
            float xPos = x * (cellSize + cellSpacing);
            float yPos = -y * (cellSize + cellSpacing);
            rectTransform.anchoredPosition = new Vector2(xPos, yPos);
            rectTransform.sizeDelta = new Vector2(cellSize, cellSize);
        }
    }
}
```
