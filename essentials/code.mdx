## Code Assistance in Coplay

Coplay is designed to enhance your coding experience in Unity by providing intelligent code assistance, generation, and problem-solving capabilities. Ask Coplay to create scripts for common game mechanics, and it will generate well-structured C# code tailored for Unity. Coplay can assist with debugging your code and even recommend code patterns.


## Best Practices for Coding with Coplay

### Be Specific with Requests

The more specific your coding request, the better Coplay can assist you:

```
// Less effective request:
"Write code for a player"

// More effective request:
"Create a C# script for a first-person controller with smooth camera movement,
jumping, and the ability to sprint when holding the Shift key"
```

### Include Context

When asking for help with existing code, include relevant parts of your code for context:

```csharp
// When asking about an error, include the relevant code and error message
"I'm getting a 'NullReferenceException' in this enemy AI controller code:

public class EnemyAI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform target;

    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(FollowTarget());
    }

    IEnumerator FollowTarget()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            // Error happens on this line
            Vector3 direction = (target.position - transform.position).normalized;
            transform.position += direction * Time.deltaTime;
            yield return null;
        }
    }
}
"
```

### Test Different Model Performance

Coplay lets you choose from different AI models. For coding tasks:

- Use faster models for quick code snippets and simple explanations
- Use more advanced models for complex implementations and debugging challenges

You can adjust your model preference in Coplay settings.
