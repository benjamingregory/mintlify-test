## Code Assistance in Coplay

Coplay is designed to enhance your coding experience in Unity by providing intelligent code assistance, generation, and problem-solving capabilities.

### Types of Code Help

Here are the ways Coplay can assist with your Unity coding tasks:

#### 1. Code Generation

Ask Coplay to create scripts for common game mechanics, and it will generate well-structured C# code tailored for Unity:

```csharp PlayerMovement.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float turnSpeed = 180f;

    private CharacterController controller;

    private void Awake()
    {
        controller = GetComponent<CharacterController>();
        if (controller == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("Character Controller component is missing!");
        }
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        // Get input axes
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        // Calculate movement direction
        Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(horizontal, 0, vertical).normalized;
        if (moveDirection.magnitude > 0.1f)
        {
            // Rotate towards movement direction
            float targetAngle = Mathf.Atan2(moveDirection.x, moveDirection.z) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0, targetAngle, 0);

            // Move in facing direction
            controller.Move(moveDirection * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Code Explanation

Coplay can explain complex Unity concepts and code patterns:

```csharp
// Ask Coplay: "Can you explain how quaternions work in Unity?"

/*
Coplay might explain:
Quaternions in Unity represent rotations in 3D space. Unlike Euler angles (x,y,z degrees),
quaternions avoid gimbal lock issues and provide smoother rotations.

Key quaternion operations in Unity:
- Quaternion.Euler(x,y,z): Converts Euler angles to a quaternion
- Quaternion.LookRotation(direction): Creates a rotation facing the direction
- Quaternion.Slerp(from, to, t): Smoothly interpolates between rotations
- transform.rotation: Property that uses quaternions to store object rotation

Example of smooth rotation toward a target:
*/

// Smoothly rotate towards a target
Quaternion targetRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(targetPosition - transform.position);
transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(transform.rotation, targetRotation, rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
```

#### 3. Debugging Assistance

When you're stuck with a bug, Coplay can analyze your code and suggest fixes:

```csharp
// Original code with a bug
void ApplyDamage(GameObject target, float amount)
{
    Health health = target.GetComponent<Health>();
    health.TakeDamage(amount);
}

// After asking Coplay about the potential null reference exception:

void ApplyDamage(GameObject target, float amount)
{
    if (target == null)
    {
        Debug.LogWarning("Target is null, cannot apply damage");
        return;
    }

    Health health = target.GetComponent<Health>();
    if (health != null)
    {
        health.TakeDamage(amount);
    }
    else
    {
        Debug.LogWarning("Target does not have a Health component");
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Coding with Coplay

### Be Specific with Requests

The more specific your coding request, the better Coplay can assist you:

```
// Less effective request:
"Write code for a player"

// More effective request:
"Create a C# script for a first-person controller with smooth camera movement,
jumping, and the ability to sprint when holding the Shift key"
```

### Include Context

When asking for help with existing code, include relevant parts of your code for context:

```csharp
// When asking about an error, include the relevant code and error message
"I'm getting a 'NullReferenceException' in this enemy AI controller code:

public class EnemyAI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform target;

    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(FollowTarget());
    }

    IEnumerator FollowTarget()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            // Error happens on this line
            Vector3 direction = (target.position - transform.position).normalized;
            transform.position += direction * Time.deltaTime;
            yield return null;
        }
    }
}
"
```

### Iterative Refinement

You can iteratively refine code with Coplay:

1. Ask for initial implementation
2. Review the code
3. Ask for specific modifications or optimizations
4. Repeat until satisfied

## Model Selection for Coding Tasks

Coplay lets you choose from different AI models. For coding tasks:

- Use faster models for quick code snippets and simple explanations
- Use more advanced models for complex implementations and debugging challenges

You can adjust your model preference in Coplay settings.
