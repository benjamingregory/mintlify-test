## Key Features

### Code Assistance

Coplay can help you with various coding tasks in Unity:

```csharp
// Ask Coplay about Unity concepts like:
"How do I implement a character controller in Unity?"

// Or get specific code help:
"Write a script to make my camera follow the player with smooth damping"

// Debug existing code:
"Why is my collision detection not working properly?"
```

### Context-Aware Conversations

Coplay understands your Unity project context, making it easier to get relevant help:

- Refer to existing GameObjects, scripts, and components in your project
- Ask about specific scenes or assets
- Get tailored advice based on your project structure

### Tips for Effective UI Navigation

1. **Context-Aware Queries**: Always select the appropriate context for your question to get the most relevant answers
2. **Mode Switching**: Change agent modes based on your current development focus
3. **Model Selection**: Use faster models for simple tasks and more advanced models for complex problems
4. **Action Recording**: Use action recording to document processes that you want to analyze or replicate later
5. **Custom Rules**: Set up custom rules to ensure Coplay aligns with your team's development standards

For more detailed information on configuring Coplay's behavior, see the [Configuration Guide](/essentials/configuration).
