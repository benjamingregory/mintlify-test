## Key Features

### Code Assistance

Coplay can help you with various coding tasks in Unity:

```csharp
// Ask Coplay about Unity concepts like:
"How do I implement a character controller in Unity?"

// Or get specific code help:
"Write a script to make my camera follow the player with smooth damping"

// Debug existing code:
"Why is my collision detection not working properly?"
```

### Working with Complex Workflows

For more complex tasks, you can use Coplay in an iterative manner:

1. Start with a high-level description of what you want to accomplish
2. Refine your request based on Coplay's responses
3. Ask for explanations of the suggested code or approaches
4. Implement the solution with Coplay's guidance

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific in Your Requests">
    The more specific your query, the more accurate Coplay's response will be.
    Include relevant details about your project, requirements, and constraints.
    **Example**: Instead of asking "How do I make a game?", try "How do I
    implement a 2D platformer character controller with wall jumping in Unity?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Project Context">
    Reference existing components and scripts in your project to get more
    tailored assistance. **Example**: "I have a PlayerController script that
    handles movement, but I want to add a dash ability. Here's my current
    movement code: ..."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Iterative Refinement">
    Don't expect perfect solutions on the first try. Use an iterative approach
    to refine your solutions. 1. Start with a basic question 2. Review Coplay's
    response 3. Ask follow-up questions to address any gaps 4. Test
    implementations and return with specific issues
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coplay isn't responding or is slow">
    Try the following:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Restart the Unity Editor
    3. Re-authenticate Coplay if needed
    4. If problems persist, try choosing a different AI model in the settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implementation suggestions aren't working correctly">
    This could be due to:
    1. Version differences - ensure you're using a compatible Unity version
    2. Missing context - provide more details about your project setup
    3. Conflicting scripts - check for interactions with existing code
    
    Try explaining the specific error you're encountering to get more targeted help.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication issues">
